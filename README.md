# Who Wants Coffee

### Stack:

1. Deployment: Vercel Website - [https://bottled-moments.vercel.app/](https://bottled-moments.vercel.app/)
2. Stack - [Vitawind](https://vitawind.vercel.app/) (only uses Vite, however the Tailwind part is still inside and available)
3. Cypress, Mocha, Cucumber --uninstalled
4. Zeplin - unused (but deployment is possible if asked / needed)
5. Storybook JS - uninstalled (not sure how to incorporate it into p5js environment, it's a bit overkill)
6. Last but not least p5.js

---

### To run application:

```

run `node server.cjs`
go to your browser and open http://localhost:5200/ (if desktop)

<!-- for some reason while installing Tailwind, it is required to specify  name change into CJS (Common JavaScript) but it does not change anything-->
```

---

### P5.js Libraries Used:

1. p5.js (1.6.0)
2. p5.js.dom
3. [P5.Buttons 2021](https://github.com/koerismo/p5.buttons)

All fonts and assets used (including favicon, lotties, fonts, svg, and webp are all within this repository)

The uses of those specific assets file formats are meant to reduce storage and waste but still optimized performance.
